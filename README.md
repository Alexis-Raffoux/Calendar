Simple export script with optional Google Calendar import.

Populate .env file with proper values (see .env.example).

Auto Google Calendar import requires setup at [Google Console API.](https://console.cloud.google.com)

You'll also have to populate a credentials.json file at the root of the project, which you can then get from [this page.](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials)

This may be a bit technical, that's why it's optional at the moment.

This script should be working for CELCAT Calendar up to v9.0.6802.2502 (maybe future versions will work just fine).
